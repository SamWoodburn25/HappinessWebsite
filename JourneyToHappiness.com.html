                So, my life's been pretty crazy lately.  I'll begin with a little background on me and then explain what this site is. If no one told you today that they love you, I do :)

            <br><br><p class="hero__description">
                          For as long as I can remmeber I have struggled with severe anxiety and major depresive disorder.  Until about one yar ago, I would have never admitted this to anyone, even myself.  Now, it's taken over my whole life. 
            </p>
            <p class="hero__description">
                          January of 2022 I forst told my parents about how much I was struggling.  I began online therapy and my parents weren't really too concerned because they weren't aware of the severity of my depression.  At this time I was a freshman at Lehigh University.  I thought my depression was just like any other college student becaus of all of the stress but the begining if second semester really sent me spiraling.  First, I was dropped from every sorority, then was left by my best friend which forced me to switch dorms, then my grades really began to drop because I was really giving up.  I thought it would be best for me to just leave Lehigh and maybe with some of those issues gone I would be feeling better,  so I dropped out with no other plans for my future.  My self harm continued to worsen and my mental illness began to affect my physical health.  Over the summer of 2022, I really wanted to begin to work on myself and focus less on the opinions of others.  I went to more in person therapy and worked two jobs.  My depression continued to worsen and my anxiety was coming in the form of nausea and vomitting to the point where I was hospitalized for five days.  After dropping out of school completely and coming home from the hospital, I was really struggling and contemplating suicide daily.  I really didn't trust myself to not do anything so in October I residential mental health rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania for three weeks.  I learned a lot throughout the program and began to see some hope for my future, which I thought would never happen.  After leaving I transitioned to and intensive partial hospitalization program provided me with ten hours of therapy each week.  Now it is January of 2023 and although I am still struggling to push through every day, I think I am doing much better and slowly making preogress.  
            </p>
            <p class="hero__description">
                          My PHP is ending soon so I wanted to make this website so I can conitnue to track my progress, keep up on all of the DBT and CBT skills, track my goals, and share all of the things I have incorporated into my daily life on my journey to happiness.  I hope this page can help at least one person in creating a new happier life style and finally overcome the monster that depression is.

I'm really stressed about the future in general: what school's going to look like, what my career will be, or just if I'll be able to make it to tommorow.  Well that's a bit dramatic but I just wanted to say, to me each day is terrifying and I really struggle with my thoughts and anxiety every minute.  This section is kind of just me trying to sort things out in my mind and hopefully it will ease some of the anxiety (me figuring out waht I want my life to look like in the future lol).</h2>
